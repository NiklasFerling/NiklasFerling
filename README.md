### Hi there 👋

My name is Niklas Ferling. I'm currently studying front-end development and this is the GitHub account where I make all of my projects.

- 🏫 Noroff University Online

So far I have had courses in HTML, CSS and JS for code languages. As well as design, project methodology, comtent management systems etc. Looking forward to my final year at Noroff and the start of my developing career!
