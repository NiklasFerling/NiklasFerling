### Hi there 👋

My name is Niklas Ferling. I'm currently studying front-end development, and this is the GitHub account where I make all of my projects.

- 🏫 Noroff School of Technology
- 📍  Lillesand (Agder), Norway
- 📧 niklas.ferling@gmail.com

During my time studying at Noroff I have learned a lot about basic code languages like HTML, CSS and JS, with a few liberaries such as React, Bootstrap, Tailwind, MUI etc. As well as design, project methodology, content management systems etc. Currently finishing my second and final year and looking forward to starting my work career as soon as possible!
